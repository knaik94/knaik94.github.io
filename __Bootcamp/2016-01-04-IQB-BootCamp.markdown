What is Cancer? A biased introduction to cancer biology
Shridar Ganesan, M.D., PhD

Cancer is a pathological state rather than a singular path taken by a cell. Generally too much growth isn't necessarily fatal, exg hyperplasia. The increase in growth along with failure to differentiate causes problems. 

Cell division requires a "nuclear launch code", a large amount of checkpoints and mechanisms.

Internal source of mutations, when replicating, is much larger than outside sources, like radiation. Ageing, prolifation rate, much more important when considering caner risk. Stochastic distribution. Early childhood also at risk beause of large amount of cell division. Cancer depends on microenvironments, very few cancer grow autonomously.

Diagnosis of cancer is independent of ideology of cancer. Targetting cancers with therapy is hard. Signal equilibrium is central to specific cancers. Cancers often have very specific pathways, so by blocking it we can target cancer. We have redundant mechanisms for all major biological functions and so there is no overall loss of function.

Classification was by anatomy and histology. This if flawed because it doesn't reflect genetic characteristics. We are at the stage of doing genetic analysis to see if there are alternative treatements.

What is a Drug? What is Drug Invention? What is Drug Development?
S. David Kimball, PhD

Small molecules are good research drugs. 

Biological Target + Active Molecule --> lead --> IND (Invesitagtional new drug) --> NCE (New chemical entity)

IND is large investment, need to find causes of failure before IND in order to minimize cost.

Biological pathways and mechanisms as potential leads: phosphoylation, ion, g-prc, enzyme regulation, transporters, agonists. Genetic: pre and post(phenotypic).

Hit-to-lead

Medicinal Chemistry

Failue analysis

Preclinical Pharmacokinetics
--> Pharmacodynamics

Half-life, proper concentration --> bioavailability

Optimize drug discovery with research.

Precision Medicine: Implications for Science and Practice
Robert S. DiPaola, MD

Past _ Present _ Future
Advances in Technology pushed forward drug discovery and genetic analysis

Biomarkers are focused in Oncology.

Pharmacogenomics.
Push to personalized medicine, very highly targeted. Multiple drug targets are important although currently most drugs are single target.

"Sloppy" drugs, cytotoxic, can hit multiple targets and are therefore a valid contingency for when personalized medicine fails.

Transform Systematic RX based on different ways of finding drug targets.

Lung Primary vs Metastasis, potential to inform Local Rx Decisions, by looking at genetic characteristics of cancer a clear answer can be drawn about locality.

Future:
Efficacy, public health
Issue with test use, ethics, public health
Issue with proper use, complicancy
Regulation of Technology, CLIA and FDA

Push toward research and targets based on genetics rather than phenotypic and anatomical characteristics for drug discovery.

Multiple targets, 10 year research study.

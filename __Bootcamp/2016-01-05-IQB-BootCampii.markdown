A vitamin used to treat hypercholesterol, Niacin.

EGFR is present at higher levels on some cancers. Directly related to unregulated proliferation. High prevelance of mutation in NSCLC and Glioblastoma.

Signaling Pathways Central to Growth and EGF/EGFR
X.F. Steven Zheng

Cell growth, repro or increase in size/organelle/protein content. There is a restriction on size due to surface area. In certain cases, like neurons and muscle fibers, grow in a linear path and are not limited by surface area. In initial cell division, a cell divides and doesn't grow in size before dividing again.

Growth regulated by mitogenic signals: nutrients, stress, tumor supressor, [GF, cytokines,hormones].

Mutation in tumor supressor cause cascade of mutations in other oncogenes (RAS, EGFR) as well as other tumor supressor genes.

G-protein coupled receptor, signal transduction (signal), ligand (binding molecule), receptor (binds specific ligand which causes internal cell change). Intracellular signaling molecules: intermediary protein, enzyme, second messenger, target protein.

We will focus on Receptor Linked Enzyme, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase

EGFR has four types of receptors, ErbB1 ErbB2 ErbB3 ErbB4, main target is ErbB1/HER1/EGFR. In oncogenesis, HER2 is usually over expressed, but it has no ligand activity. 

Ligand induces dimerization (receptor crosslinking), this causes opening of active site. This can also cause endocytosis, internalizing the receptors. RAS activated by GRB2 (that binds to phosphorlated protein) and SOS. RAS primarily targets RAF kinase -> MEK -> ERK -> proliferation, survival, transformation . Also PI3K (converts PIP2 -> PIP3) which regulates translation, autophagy, metabolism, and stress resistance.	

EGFR, lung, two point mutation, opens up catalytic cleft without activation (always active).

Erlotinib small TKI. Biologics: antibody.

Initiating a protein kinase drug discovery program
Peter R Young

TPP (Target Product Profile) - profile of focus (administration, mechanism, relavence, efficacy)

Protein Kinases are varied and so selectivity is very important for drug development. They all have multiple activation methods.

Single endpoint assay.

Maximize output of assay, validation experiements.

Kinase + peptide + ATP -> Kinase + phosphopeptide + adp
Two usbtrates, peptides eachwith own Km

Radioactive assay in past, now flourescent.

Flourescence polarization.

Luminescent Protein Kinase.

Competition Binding Assay.

IC50 for an inhibitor, 50% of inhibition.
Usually triplicate Assay.

Screening for potential drugs is based on practicality rather than possibility. Virtual screening is prominent in the field. Irreversible inhibitor has renewed inerest.

High throughput screen.

Z prime or Z factor, variablility around control. Seperation of outcomes.

Cell based assays
Target engagement

Fluorescent probe both in vitro and in vivo.

#Day 4

ADME (Absorption/Distribution/Metabolism/Excretion)
Imad Hanna, Novartis

Target exposure in humans is ultimate goal. Humans are much more complex than in vitro and in vivo studies, usually we measure blood/plasma levels, excretion.

Most drugs are non-specific and increase dosage greatly increases risk of adverse effects by off-target interactions.

Man as an industrial palace. Historically, specificity was not a concern and this is why a lot of drugs were ineffective.

Calibration curve, absorptive permeability vs % absorbed, P asbp = change Q / (change t x C initial x Area). Current market has a lot of drugs that ionize that is dependent on pH. Lipophilicity can counteract low absorption due to charge.

Although exceptions exist, general guidelines, Lipinski's Rule for orally active drugs:
•  Not more that 5 H-bond donors (e.g., R-OH, R-NH) 
•  Not more that 10 H-bond acceptors (N or O atoms) 
•  Molecular weigh less that 500 g∙mol -1 
•  Log P not greater than 5 

Quadrants: solubility vs permeability
1. high solubility/permeability/rapid dissolution
2. low solubility, high permeability
3. high solubility, low permeability
4. low solubility/permeability

Bioavailability = Fa *Fg *Fh 
 
Fa :  Fraction of the oral dose 
available for absorption 
Fg :  Fraction metabolized in the 
gut 
Fh :  Fraction metabolized in the 
liver 

Bioavailability depends on metabolism and is not directly proportional to absorption.

Caco-2 is preferable to PAMPA because of active transporter systems.

Max plasma levels: (integral of time vs plasma concentration gives exposure)
high solubility: 1 hour
medium solubility: 3 hours
low solu: 8 hours

Vd, apparent volume, measure of effective distribution. Radioactivity can be used to see distribution, but it does not necessarily correlate with active drug level nor drug level at active site.

Free drug hypothesis comes from theory related to vascular endothelium, cell memberane, and specialized trans membrane proteins (that can act as barriers).

Blood to plasma ratio, blood (organ) clearance is measured using ratio as a measure of how much passes unaffected.

Metabolism, bile, excretion. Biliary, Renal, Intestinal secretion. 
dAe/dt = CLr · C = CLr,u · Cu = GFR · Cu = GFR · C · fu 
CLr = GFR · fu 

§  Physicochemical properties of drug molecules is the most important 
determinant of absorption and disposition  
§  Compounds need to attain sufficient concentrations at the biological 
target in order to be efficacious 
§  Biotransformation (CYP450/UGTs) is the main determinant of 
elimination of most marketed drugs.  
§  Transport-mediated disposition and the interplay between transporters 
and drug metabolizing enzymes is becoming more appreciated as a 
determinant of clearance 
§  Excretion occurs predominantly by the biliary and/or the renal route; 
other routes of excretion are normally minor 

Pharmacokinetics
Ry Forseth, Ph.D

“PK is the study of the way drug molecules behave in the 
body after administration” 

Way/Behave, extent and time. In the Body, location of absorption. Administration, Oral, IV, Subcutaneous, IM.

Use case of drug dictates target mechanism and target half life by which the drug should be absporbed. 

Q: How early can you effectively predict drug interactions?

PK: After a drug is dosed, how is the concentration of that 
agent in the body changing with respect to time? 
 
PD: What is the relationship between drug concentrations 
and the observed therapeutic effect(s)? 

I free is concentration of inhibitor, Ki want as small as possible.

GLP : Good laboratory practice

Concetration vs Time, AUC (integral) indicates exposure
ka abportion rate.

AUMC (double integral of concentration vs time) or (integral of AUC)

Generally first order

Consider half life after distribution phase. 

Allometry.

Influence of exponent.
Blood to liver. Liver enzymes.

5 half lives -> steady state

§ PK is an important part of drug development, providing the 
tools and expertise to support the determination of a safe 
and efficacious dose and regimen for small molecule 
therapies. 
§  PK relates observables such as plasma concentrations to 
underlying physiological mechanisms that modulate drug 
disposition. 
§ To support the progression of a drug to Phase I clinical 
studies, PK can provide rationale for how observations 
made in preclinical species can be applied to humans.   

Pharmacodynamics
Christina S. Won, PharmD, PhD

Kaplin Meyer Curves, Mathematical Modeling for time frames

Ocology uses MTD(maximum tolerated dose) model where PD is not always considered intensely.

Immuno onoclogy seems interesting.

IC50 - 50% inhibition of cell pathways, GI50 - reduce growth rate to 50% of maximum, ED50 - 50% of maximum measure effect, LD50 - 50% of cells die

 Indirect (effect compartment) 
-  Could be due to slow receptor binding, distributional delay, or transduction delay

Counterclockwise - hysteresis 

Multicompartent (add compartment as a site of extra interaction)

Sigmoind Emax (hill equation)
Empirical

Multiple models for Tumor growth

How can we translate PD data obtained in pre-clinical 
studies to what one may observe in a clinical setting?  
§  Unlike allometric methods applied to PK parameters, it is rare to see allometry 
applied to PD parameters. 
•  Example: Zuideveld et al 2007

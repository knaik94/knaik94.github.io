IQB 2016
The Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine (“Proteomics”), with field trips

![Me in the Northface]({{ "/img/Me.jpg" }})

Jan. 4-15, 2016 9:00am to 3:00pm (7 of work days over winter break, 2 days RU facility tours, 1 final presentation day)

GOAL: "Find" a molecule to treat non-small cell lung cancer, get an ivestigational new therapy application IND "approved", perpare a New Drug Application NDA based on potential "found" drug, and finally present our findings/package to an Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee/FDA Simulation who would reccomend our found drug for appoval or rejection by the FDA. (Panel made up of PHD in Chemistry, Professionals in the field that gave the lectures, as well as Professionals from J&J) (Drug prechosen erlotinib)

What I learned:
How complex "curing" cancer is, how are drugs discovered, a lot of biomed/biochem, AMBER, medicinal chemistry, how drugs are processed in the body: PK and drug elimination pk equation for elimiation rate, PD and target binding and the biochem, drug ethics, and how toxicology/LD50 is test with different animal models, oncology drugs are unique when testing invivo and why side effects are so serious, AMBER II: finding if candidate drug will interact based on computer simulations, IRB and approval for phase I trial, phase 2 trials, phase 3 trials and population used in each and what kind of side effects are reported, and how many drugs fail at this stage, ethics of drug testing, double blind, double blind crossover, how drugs can fail to come to market even if they work it's considered a failure because it didn't achieve the target set intially before starting the phase trials, and how to prepare a package/presentation with a team and present to a mock FDA committee that approves or rejects a drug.

BROCHURE


WHAT:    Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology Boot Camp: Drug Discovery and Development

Talks on fundamental and applied aspects associated with the myriad stages of drug discovery and development
Decision-making and activities as employees of a hypothetical biotechnology company charged with developing new drugs
Hands-on simulations and exercises using mathematical models, statistical methods, and computational chemistry; medicinal chemistry designs and analyses; modeling of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes; and analyses of real cancer data that enable individual treatment planning
Tours of some of Rutgers state-of-the-art facilities for interrogating biological phenomena
Sharing of insights and information with teammates and the larger group as part of the drug discovery and development process
Understanding of the processes involved in bringing a program from target selection, lead discovery/optimization, preclinical development, drug candidate selection, patenting, preparation of the Investigational New Drug Application, the clinical trials process, to the final FDA review/decision
The Boot Camp will conclude with a student-led simulation of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting leading to FDA approval for the company’s new drug candidate
A unique form of education and fun!
